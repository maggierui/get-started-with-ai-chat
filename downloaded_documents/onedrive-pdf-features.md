#### Annotation and markup tools for enhancing collaboration

The “Annotation and Markup Tools” feature facilitates an optimized collaboration for a team that uses a PDF as a medium of communication in the project. This feature helps the team members to allow annotations, editing tools in the PDF to represent their suggestions/ideas/views about the project within their team. This feature enables the team members avoid using collaboration sessions to convey each suggestion/idea/view. This feature enables reduction in the count of sessions of collaboration about the project for each member to share (if they have any) suggestion/idea/view about any specific facet in the project.

To annotate a PDF in OneDrive using markup tools, perform the following steps:

1. Find the PDF you want to annotate in your OneDrive and select it for the PDF to launch.
1. Select **Annotation** to enter “editing” mode at the bottom of the PDF screen:

#### Bookmark PDF pages

To add a bookmark in a PDF, perform the following steps:

1. Select **Bookmark** at the bottom of the PDF screen to add a bookmark to the current page you’re viewing.

   :::image type="content" source="media/bookmark-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page on which the Bookmark option is displayed for the user to select it." lightbox="media/bookmark-option.png":::

   Once you’ve added the bookmark, you'll see a dialog box displaying a confirmation message at the top of the screen as shown in the following screenshot:

   You can add bookmark to any page and any number of pages of choice by implementing the preceding step.

**Viewing bookmarks added to multiple pages**

If you’ve added bookmarks to multiple pages and want to view those bookmarks, perform the following steps:

1. Select the **Thumbnail** icon at the top–right of the screen.

   :::image type="content" source="media/thumbnail-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page containing the Thumbnail icon." lightbox="media/thumbnail-icon.png":::

   The page shows the **All Pages**, **Bookmarked**, and **Annotated** options in "thumbnail" view.

#### Change the appearance of your PDF - Optimize PDF viewing by using various reading modes

The “Optimized PDF Viewing with Reading Mode” feature can be applied when the default view of the PDF isn’t conducive to be read in the current environment/surroundings the user is in. This feature enables the user to customize the PDF’s background to sync with the environment in which you’re going to read the PDF.

Customizing PDFs' background refers to changing the PDF’s default mode for reading (the mode as is on your PC or mobile when you open the PDF) to “dark” mode, “sepia” mode, or “light” mode.

To change a PDF’s background, perform the following steps:

1. Open a PDF in OneDrive for Android and click anywhere to expand the bottom sheet of the screen.
1. Select **Appearance**.
1. Select a colored circle that corresponds to the reading mode that you want to set for the PDF.

#### Rotating PDF pages to adjust a PDF pages' orientation

The ”Page Rotation” feature enables the user to adjust a PDF page’s orientation wherein a page that has been saved upside down or sideways is rotated to bring it to the “straight” position. This feature is especially useful when there are multiple pages that have been saved upside down or sideways.

The process of applying the "rotate" feature is depicted in the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/rotate-od-ios.gif" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the process of applying the rotate feature." lightbox="media/rotate-od-ios.gif":::

**Rotating a single page that has a sideways' or upside-down orientation**

To rotate a single page, perform the following steps:

1. Open the OneDrive app on your iOS or Android mobile; then open the PDF containing the page you want to rotate.
1. Scroll to the page that you want to rotate and click on an area where no text is there. A dialog box pops up. 
1. Select **Rotate** to rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise. Keep selecting Rotate for more 90-degree turns until the page reaches the straight orientation.

**Rotating multiple pages with a sideways' or upside-down orientation**

To rotate multiple pages, perform the following steps:

1. Open the OneDrive app on your iOS or Android mobile; then open the PDF containing the pages you want to rotate.
1. Select the **Thumbnail** icon at the top of the screen to show a thumbnail view of the PDF’s pages.

   :::image type="content" source="media/thumbnail-icon-click.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the thumbnail icon for the page to be displayed in thumbnail view." lightbox="media/thumbnail-icon-click.png":::

1. Select **Select**. The screen containing all the pages of the PDF (opened in Step-1) appears.
1. Click on the pages you want to rotate (pages get selected for rotation on being clicked)
   OR select **Select all** if you want to rotate all the pages.
1. Click the **Rotate** icon on the toolbar at the bottom of your screen to rotate the pages you have selected 90 degrees clockwise.

#### Jump to specific PDF page using Table of Contents

The “Quick page-navigation using Table of Contents (TOC)” feature enables smooth/easy navigation in a lengthy/large PDF. This feature displays each chapter’s/section’s title along with their page numbers. This provision enables the user to navigate quickly to the desired chapter section on account of they knowing the page number.

To view a PDF’s TOC to use its clickable chapter's/section's page numbers, perform the following steps:

1. Select the **TOC** icon at the top–right of the PDF screen.

   :::image type="content" source="media/toc-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the TOC icon for the user to click." lightbox="media/toc-icon.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > This icon is displayed if the PDF includes TOC-related data irrespective of which location in the PDF hosts the TOC-related data. If the TOC-related data isn't found anywhere in a PDF, then such a PDF won't display the TOC icon on the UI.  

   The TOC—with clickable chapters and sections—is displayed on the left side of the screen.
