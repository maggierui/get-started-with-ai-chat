# Step 3: Copy to Drive migrations tab for Google migration

After your Google Drives are scanned, the drive status will show if it's "Ready to migrate" and error-free.

1. In the **Drives** tab, select the tasks (Drives) with a scan status of "Ready to migrate".
1. Select **Copy to Drive migrations** from the action bar to activate the "Copy to migrations" setting panel.
1. Edit **Destinations**. You can apply [Single destination edit](/sharepointmigration/mm-google-step4-review-destinations#single-destination-edits) or [Upload destinations using a CSV file](/sharepointmigration/mm-google-step4-review-destinations#upload-destinations-using-a-csv-file) to designate where you want to migrate these selected tasks.
1. Review **Task migration settings**. You can either follow the [Project settings](/sharepointmigration/mm-project-settings) or customize the task settings.
1. Select **Copy to Drive migrations** to send the tasks to **Drive migrations** tab for subsequent migration operations.
1. Go to the **Drive Migrations** tab and proceed to the next step.
