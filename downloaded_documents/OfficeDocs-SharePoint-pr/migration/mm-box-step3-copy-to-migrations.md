# Step 3: Copy to migration list using Migration Manager

After the Box users are scanned and marked as ready, add them to your migration list.

1. In the **Users** tab, select the tasks (users) with a scan status of *Ready to migrate* or *Completed*.
1. Select **Copy to User migrations** from the menu bar to activate "Copy to migrations" setting panel.
1. Edit **Destinations**. You can apply [Single destination edit](/sharepointmigration/mm-box-step4-review-destinations#single-destination-edit) or [Upload destinations using a CSV file](/sharepointmigration/mm-box-step4-review-destinations#upload-destinations-using-a-csv-file) to designate where you want to migrate these selected tasks.
1. Review **Task migration settings**. You can either follow the [Project settings](/sharepointmigration/mm-project-settings) or customize the task settings.
1. Select **Copy to User migrations** to send the tasks to **User migrations** tab for subsequent migration operations.
1. Go to the **User Migrations** tab and proceed to the next step.
