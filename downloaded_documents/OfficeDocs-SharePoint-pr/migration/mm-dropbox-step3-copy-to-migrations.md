# Step 3: Copy to migrations tab for Dropbox migration

After your Dropbox folders are scanned and marked as ready, add them to your migration list.

1. Select **Copy to Folder migrations** from the menu bar to activate the "Copy to migrations" setting panel.
1. Edit **Destinations**. You can apply [Single destination edit](/sharepointmigration/mm-dropbox-step4-review-destinations#edit-a-destination) or [Upload destinations using a CSV file](/sharepointmigration/mm-dropbox-step4-review-destinations#upload-destinations-using-a-csv-file) to designate where you want to migrate these selected tasks.
