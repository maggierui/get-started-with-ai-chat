# Step 4: Monitoring and reporting status of migration tasks

After you select **Migrate**, the progress of your migration task appears. As they complete, you can view either detailed or summary reports of an individual task or a single summary report that includes all migration jobs submitted during this session. To learn more, see [Using the SharePoint Migration Tool Reports](using-the-sharepoint-migration-tool-reports.md).

The SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) generates log files, summary reports, and task level reports. This information helps you manage, audit, and troubleshoot your migration process.

## Monitor your migration

The **migration job** progress report shows the overall progress of the migration job. Users can:

- Pause and resume all migration tasks
- Check the time elapsed and time remaining
- Observe migration performance suggestions

The **migration task** progress report shows the progress of individual migration tasks. Users can:

- Pause and resume a migration task
- Delete a migration task
- Check the time elapsed and the time remaining
- Watch migration stats
- View reports

## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.

### Viewing task level reports:

1. After the migration begins, select **View reports**.
1. A file folder opens, listing the task-level reports generated for that specific task.

### Viewing summary reports:

1. After migration completes, select **Migration details**.
1. A folder with the summary reports opens.

## Summary Reports

Two types of summary reports are generated. The second type of summary report generated only if there are failures.

- **SummaryReport.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture total size, number of files migrated, and duration.
- **FailureSummary.csv.** This report is created only when failures or errors happen during the migration process.

When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports. If a FailureSummary.csv file wasn't created, then no failures occurred during the task run.

### Summary Report

|Migrated GB in current round |The total size of the files migrated, expressed in gigabytes. |
|GB not migrated in current round |The total size of the files not migrated, expressed in gigabytes. |
|Total scanned items |The total number of files and list items, including those files and list items filtered out because of settings or potential scan issues. |

### Failure Summary Report

This report is only generated if a failure occurs during the job run.

## Task Reports

When you need to do a deeper investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details. The four recommended task level reports to use are:

- **ItemSummary.csv:** This report is similar to the overall summary report except that it aggregates the data just for a single task.
- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** The failure report at the item level. This report is a filtered version of the files report, showing only failures.
- **ItemReport.csv:** A list of all the items this task attempted to do.
- **ScanSummary.csv:** This report gives statistical totals.
- **StructureReport.csv:** A structured report at the task level.
- **StructureFailureReport.csv:** A structured failure report at the task level.
- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:** This report is an aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This report is only generated if there are failures.
