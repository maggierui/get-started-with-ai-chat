**What are the license requirements?**

Your organization needs to have the right license and meet certain administrative permissions or roles to use the feature described in this article.

First, your organization must have one of the following base licenses:

- Office 365 E3, E5, or A5
- Microsoft 365 E1, E3, E5, or A5

Additionally, you need at least one of these licenses:

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot license:** At least one user in your organization must be assigned a Copilot license (this user doesn't need to be a SharePoint administrator).
- **Microsoft SharePoint Advanced Management license:** Available as a standalone purchase.

**Administrator requirements**

You must be a [SharePoint administrator](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) or have equivalent permissions.

**Additional information**

If your organization has a Copilot license and at least one person in your organization is assigned a Copilot license, SharePoint administrators automatically gain access to the [SharePoint Advanced Management features needed for Copilot deployment](/sharepoint/sharepoint-advanced-management-licensing#sharepoint-advanced-management-features-in-microsoft-365-copilot-licenses).

For organizations without a Copilot license, you can use SharePoint Advanced Management features [by purchasing a standalone SharePoint Advanced Management license](/sharepoint/advanced-management#licensing).
