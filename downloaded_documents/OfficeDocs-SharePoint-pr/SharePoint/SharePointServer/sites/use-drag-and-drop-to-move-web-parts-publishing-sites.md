# Use Drag and Drop to move web parts in publishing sites

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

When using a modern browser (newer versions of Chrome, Edge, etc), users can now move web parts between page sections or change web part order within page sections when editing a page within a Publishing site.

## Steps to move web parts using drag and drop

Use the following steps to move web parts in a publishing site:

1. Browse to a publishing site and edit the page.

2. Hover over the header / title bar for any web part on the page. The mouse cursor should change to a 4-way arrow.

3. Click and hold, and drag the web part to any other section on the page and drop it there.

These steps can also be used to reorder web parts within a page section.
